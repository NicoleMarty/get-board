[# Board Game Library](https://my-game-library.herokuapp.com/)
Project 3 for UMN Bootcamp

## Description 
Board Game Library is an application that stores your board games in one place that is attached to a certain user. There is a page that displays a users games where you can edit the game or delete it. This page also has a link to rules for the game, just in case the user has lost their physical copy. Users can explore games through the Board Game Atlas API and add the searched games to their library OR add the games manually by filling out a form. 

## Motivation
This application is for those that play board games with their friends. Our application can help suggest games from the users library with filters the user adds. Instead of going through your entire library, this way, you are only going through a smaller selection.
